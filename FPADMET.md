# ADMET Properties Studied

## Anticommensal effect on the human gut microbiota (HGM)
Some of the existing drugs that are designed to target human cells can notably alter the composition of the HGM. This anticommensal effect of the drugs should therefore be avoided.

## Blood Brain Barrier Permeability
Diffusion of drugs across blood brain barrier (endothelium separating the blood from the central nervous system) is quite restrictive. Early assessment
of BBB permeation is therefore of great importance, not only for CNS-active agents, but also for drugs that must be forbidden entry into the CNS (to prevent harmful side effects).

## Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Inhibition
The Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is seen to responsible for the multidrug resistance phenomenon observed in some cancers and is also involved in drug-drug interactions in the liver. Identification of potent and selective
inhibitors of BCRP is therefore of great interest to medicinal chemistry groups. 

## Human Oral bioavailability
The oral bioavailability (an important pharmacokinetic property) measures the extent to which the active moiety is absorbed and becomes available in the systemic circulation. Since most drugs are administered orally, bioavailability decreases and methods that can differentiate between high and low bioavailability can help reduce undesirable attrition.

## CYP450 Metabolism
The cytochrome P450 superfamily oxidize steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics, and are important for the clearance of various compounds. Adverse side effects of drug–drug interactions induced by human CYP450 inhibition is a major cause for concern. Here the models predict inhibition f five major CYP450 isoforms, namely, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4.

## DMSO Solubility
Solubility of drugs in Dimethyl Sulfoxide is an important parameter considered by pharmaceutical companies. Nonsoluble compunds cannot be used in automatized high-throughput screening (HTS) and  thus experimental measurements cannot be obtained for such compounds.



## Fraction Unbound in Human Plasma
The fraction unbound in plasma is an important determinant of drug efficacy in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.

## Fraction Unbound in Brain
Knowing the value of the unbound drug fraction in the brain is essential in estimating its effects and toxicity on the central nervous system.


## Human Intestinal Absorption
Human intestinal absorption (HIA) is an alternative indicator for oral bioavailability to some extent and thus plays an important role in preclinical drug evaluation. A HIA value of 30% was used as the criterion to divide chemical agents into the good absorption (Positive) and the poor-absorption (Negative) classes.

## Human Liver Microsomal Clearance
Microsomal lability assays are widely employed in drug discovery to identify compounds that will have desirable pharmacokinetics in humans. Here models have been established to predict the microsomal lability in different species: rat, mouse and humans.

## Human Liver Microsomal Stability
The human liver microsomal (HLM) stability assay is commonly used for assessing clearance of  chemicals by the human liver. Here, a $$$T\frac{1}{2}$$$ of 30 min was used to categorize a compound as stable ($$$T\frac{1}{2} > 30$$$ min) or unstable ($$$T\frac{1}{2} \leq 30$$$ min) in an HLM assay.


## Hepatocellular organic anion transporting polypeptide Inhibition
Hepatocellular organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1) are important for liver function and the regulation of the drug elimination process. OATP1B inhibition or induction may be the underlying mechanism of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. Goal is to build models that can predict hepatic OATP inhibitory capacity of new molecules.

## Drug affinity to Human Serum Albumin
Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma. Binding of drugs to HSA strongly influences their pharmacokinetic behaviour and is associated with drug-drug interactions and drug safety. The model predicts $$$\log KHSA$$$: the binding constant obtained from the retention time on an immobilized HSA column using affinity chromatography.

## Drug Interactions With the Human Bile Salt Export Pump
Drug-induced liver injury is frequently associated with inhibition of bile salt transporters such as the bile salt export pump (BSEP) which is mainly expressed in the liver. The model predicts BSEP inhibition.

## Drug transport across the human placenta barrier
The human placental barrier permeability of drugs is essential for drug safety during pregnancy. The regression model predicts placental transfer expressed by clearance index values.

## *in Vivo* Intrinsic Clearance
Hepatic metabolism is a key determinant for drug clearance. Predicting the intrinsic metabolic clearance CL$$$_{int}$$$ would go a long way in assessing drug safety and pharmacodynamics. The CL$$$_{int}$$$ data were negative-log
transformed prior to modeling.

## logD
The lipophilicity at pH = 7.4 (the physiological pH of blood serum), is a major determinant of various  ADMET parameters of drug candidates. It is said to be a  better descriptor of the lipophilicity of a molecule.

## logS
The aqueous solubility of compounds has a key role in various domains. The database AqSolDB contains experimental solubility values that were all standardized to the LogS units. Compounds can be classified according to solubility values (LogS):
1. Compounds with 0 and higher solubility value are highly soluble
2. Those in the range of 0 to −2 are soluble
3. Those in the range of −2 to −4 are slightly soluble
4. Insoluble if less than −4

## Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line permeability
## CACO-2 Permeability
The absorption of oral drugs occurs in the small intestine where the drug has to traverse the semipermeable intestinal columnar epithelial cells. *In vitro* permeability assays mimick the oral absorption process. Examples include Caco-2 (human colon adenocarcinoma), MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney). For MDCK, the model predicts MDCK permeability coefficients (apparent permeability, P$$$_{app}$$$).

## Metabolic Intrinsic Clearance
A key consideration at the screening stages of drug discovery is *in vitro* metabolic stability, often measured in human liver microsomes. Classification models were created for CL$$$_{int}$$$ based on:
1. stable if CL$$$_{int}<$$$ 20 mL/min/mg, moderate
2. if $$$20 < CL_{int} < 300$$$ mL/min/mg,
3. unstable if $$$CL_{int} \geq 300$$$ mL/min/mg

## Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Transporter 1 Inhibition
The human multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporter 1 contributes to the tissue distribution and excretion of many drugs. Inhibition of MATE1 can impact potential drug−drug interactions (DDIs) and cause alterations in drug exposure and accumulation in various tissues.

## Organic Cation Transporter 2 inhibtion
The kidney represents an important site for drug-drug interactions. Most registered drugs are eliminated via the kidneys. Hepatic metabolism is usually
followed by renal excretion of the formed metabolites. Consequently, inhibition of renal drug transport can result in significantly altered systemic levels of the parent drug molecule and of potentially active metabolites, with ultimate effects on the drug’s pharmacological and toxicological profile.

## Substrates/inhibitors of P-glycoprotein
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has significant impact on the multidrug resistance and pharmacokinetics of drugs. Compounds actively transported by P-gp are
classified as substrates, whereas those that compromise the transporting
function of P-gp are classified as inhibitors.


## Prediction of $$$pK_a$$$
The acid−base dissociation constant, pKa, is a key parameter to define the ionization state of a compound and directly affects its biopharmaceutical profile.

## human plasma protein binding
Plasma protein binding (PPB) is a key player of drug ADME. Drugs with high PPB, especially those with a narrow therapeutic window, tend to be associated with safety issues and adverse effects. In order to determine the extent of PPB of new drug candidates, the data was divided into three sets of:
1. high binding level (PPB$$$>$$$0.8),
2. moderate binding level (PPB = 0.4-0.8)
3. low binding level (PPB$$$<$$$0.4).

## Human Renal Clearance
Renal clearance (CLr) plays an important role in the elimination of drugs. While the paper by Chen et al., (https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00447) focuses more on a classification model, we have retained the regression approach.

## Rate of skin penetration
Predicting the rate of transdermal delivery is  required as part of toxicological risk assessments and is important for both pharmaceuticals and the cosmetic industry. The model predicts the permeation rate ($$$\log\ K_p$$$) of chemical compounds through human skin.

## Ionization effect on human skin permeability
The skin permeability of an active ingredient can be impacted by its ionization in a dose solution. The model predicts *in vitro* human skin permeability coefficients $$$\log\ k_p$$$.

## Skin Sensitization
Models have beeb developed with *in vitro*, *in chemico*, mice and human *in vivo* data, to predict human effects. Different models were developed for
1. the direct peptide reactivity assay (DPRA)
2. KeratinoSens
3. human cell line activation (h-CLAT)
4. local lymph node assay (LLNA)

## Cancer potency
## Carcinogenicity
The model carcinogenic potency of compounds based on TD$$$_{50}$$$ values of rats and mice. Prior to modelling, the data is converted into pTD50. 
For the second model, data from the Carcinogenic Potency Database was to distinguish between carcinogens and non-carcinogens.

## Metabolic Stability
The model provides predictions of metabolic stability expressed as T$$$_\frac{1}{2}$$$ (in hours). The cutoffs for metabolic stability class division were as follows:
1. $$$\leq$$$ 0.6 - low
2. 0.6 -- 2.32    - medium
3. $$$>$$$ 2.32   - high

## Steady state volume distribution
The steady state volume of distribution ($$$VD_{ss}$$$), is a pharmacokinetic parameter representing an individual drug’s propensity to either remain in the plasma or redistribute to other tissue compartments. 
1. High $$$VD_{ss}$$$ : More distribution to other tissue
2. Low $$$VD_{ss}$$$  : Less distribution to other tissue

## $$$LD_{50}$$$ rat acute oral toxicity
The median lethal dose for rodent oral acute toxicity ($$$LD_{50}$$$) is required to categorize chemicals in terms of the potential hazard posed to human health after acute exposure. Here we use the EPA hazard classification
EPA’s 4-category hazard classification [20]:
1. Category I ($$$LD_{50} \leq $$$ 50 mg/kg) is the highest toxicity category.
2. Category II (moderately toxic) includes chemicals with 50 < $$$LD_{50} \leq 500$$$ mg/kg.
3. Category III (slightly toxic) includes chemicals with 500 < $$$LD_{50}$$$ ≤ 5000 mg/kg. Safe chemicals
4. $$$LD_{50}$$$ > 5000 mg/kg are included in Category IV.

## AMES mutagenecity
Mutagenecity is a prime indicator of toxicity that can cause mutations in the DNA of the test organism. The model predicts whether the compound is mutagenic or not.

## Cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity is the degree to which a compound causes damage to cells. Numerous assays are used to screen compounds, and in this study models for different assays have been analysed
1. *in vitro* toxicity against HepG2 cells
2. Human embryonic kidney 293 cell (HEK 293)
3. NIH/3T3
4. CRL-7250
5. HaCat

## Drug induced Liver injury (DILI)
Early stage discovery of DILI is much desired. The classification model focuses on distinguishing between DILI-positive and DILI-negative compounds. DILI has several manifestations:
1. Drug-induced Choleostasis: Cholestatic liver injury i.e. cholestasis, is the disruption of the bile flow
2. Drug-induced toxic myopathy (rare adverse drug reaction) can cause skeletal muscle damage and pain. Another related muscle related issue is that of frug-induced rhabdomyolysis which causes death of muscle fibers and release of their contents into the bloodstream.
3. Hemolytic Toxicity: This form of toxicity can cause lysis of the erythrocyte membrane and subsequent release of hemoglobin into blood plasma, leading to multiple acute and chronic adverse effects. Two models have been proposed
	1. Prediction of hemolytic toxicity of small molecules with experimental values of $$$HD_{50}$$$
	2. hemolytic toxicity of saponins
4. Drug-induced myelotoxicity usually leads to decrease the production of platelets, red cells, and white cells.
5. Mitochondrial Toxicity: Mitochondria play a central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. A side effect of certain antiretroviral drugs causes the mitochondria of a body's cells to become damaged or decline significantly in number. The model predicts whether a drug is a mitochondrial toxic compounds or negatives (i. e. Non-mitochondrial toxic compounds).
6. Drug-induced ototoxicity: Some drugs currently in clinical use can cause cellular degeneration of cochlear and/or vestibular system, leading to temporary or permanent hearing loss or other ear problems. The model distinguishes between ototoxicants and non-toxicants.
7. Respiratory Toxicity: Drug-induced respiratory toxicity can cause significant toxicological issues. Cclinical symptoms mainly include wheezing, bronchoconstriction, asthmatic attacks and pulmonary eosinophilia.
8. Drug Phototoxicity: Photosensitization is a significant safety concern for drug development in certain chronic disease indications where patients are exposed to sunlight. Drug photosensitization (photoirritation/photoallergy) can result in side effects such as rashes or dermatitis.  Here we focus on two models:
	1. *in vitro* phototoxicity (3T3 NRU phototoxicity reports)
	2. human photosensitization (clinical photosensitization alerts)
9. Urinary tract toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity is the poisonous effect of some substances, both toxic chemicals and medications, on kidney function.  According to the regulation of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, compounds
were categorized into two classes: 
	1. Compounds with LD50 500 mg/kg were defined as urinary tract toxicants
	2. Compounds with LD50 > 500 mg/kg were set as urinary tract non-toxicants
10. Phospholipidosis: The drug-induced accumulation of phospholipids in lysosomes of various tissues is predominantly observed after prolonged exposure. 
11. Hepatic Steatosis: Fatty liver also known as hepatic steatosis, occurs when fat builds up in the liver. It is a rare form of DILI.


## hERG-induced cardiotoxicity
## hERG liability
Blockade of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel by small molecules leads to fatal cardiotoxicity. The binary classification model is used for cardiotoxic risk assessment.
A second model is used to discriminate potential hERG blockers from non-blockers.
